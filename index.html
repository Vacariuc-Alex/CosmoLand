                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Outer space</b>, or simply <b>space</b>,
                        is the expanse that exists beyond the Earth
                        and between
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object" target="_blank">celestial bodies</a>
                        Outer space is not completely empty—it is a
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#Measurement" target="_blank">hard vacuum</a>
                        containing a low density of particles, predominantly a
                        plasma of hydrogen and helium, as well as electromagnetic radiation,
                        magnetic fields, neutrinos, dust, and cosmic rays. The baseline
                        temperature of outer space, as set by the background radiation from
                        the Big Bang, is 2.7 kelvins (−270.45 °C; −454.81 °F). The plasma
                        between galaxies accounts for about half of the baryonic (ordinary)
                        matter in the universe; it has a number density of less than one
                        hydrogen atom per cubic metre and a temperature of millions of
                        kelvins. Local concentrations of matter have condensed into stars
                        and galaxies. Studies indicate that 90% of the mass in most galaxies
                        is in an unknown form, called dark matter, which interacts with other
                        matter through gravitational but not electromagnetic forces.
                        Observations suggest that the majority of the mass-energy in the
                        observable universe is dark energy, a type of vacuum energy that is
                        poorly understood. Intergalactic space takes up most of the
                        volume of the universe, but even galaxies and star systems consist
                        almost entirely of empty space.

                        an altitude of 100 km (62 mi) above sea level,
                        is conventionally used as the start of outer space in space treaties and
                        for aerospace records keeping. The framework for international space law
                        was established by the Outer Space Treaty, which entered into force on 10
                        October 1967. This treaty precludes any claims of national sovereignty and
                        permits all states to freely explore outer space. Despite the drafting of UN
                        resolutions for the peaceful uses of outer space, anti-satellite weapons have
                        been tested in Earth orbit.

                        the advent of high-altitude balloon flights. This was followed by manned

                        of the Soviet Union in 1961. Due to the high cost of getting into space,
                        manned spaceflight has been limited to low Earth orbit and the Moon. On the
                        other hand, unmanned spacecraft have reached all of the known planets in the

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <b>Big Bang theory</b> is a cosmological model for the observable universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale
                        evolution. The model describes how the universe expanded from a very high-density and high-temperature state, and offers a comprehensive
                        explanation for a broad range of phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background" target="_blank">cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation</a>,
                        large-scale
                        structure and Hubble's law (the farther away galaxies are, the faster they are moving away from Earth). If the observed conditions are extrapolated
                        backwards in time using the known laws of physics, the prediction is that just before a period of very high density there was a singularity which is
                        typically associated with the Big Bang. Current knowledge is insufficient to determine if the singularity was primordial.

                        held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to
                        Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the
                        night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense
                        distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations

                        out of its magnetic poles. This radiation can be observed only when a beam of emission is pointing toward Earth
                        (much like the way a lighthouse can be seen only when the light is pointed in the direction of an observer), and is responsible for the pulsed
                        appearance of emission. Neutron stars are very dense, and have short, regular rotational periods. This produces a very precise interval between
                        pulses that ranges from milliseconds to seconds for an individual pulsar. Pulsars are one of the candidates for the source of

                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black hole is a region of spacetime exhibiting gravitational acceleration so strong that nothing—no particles
                        or even electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass
                        can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although
                        the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, no locally detectable features appear to be observed.
                        In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light. Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts
                        that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation" target="_blank">the same spectrum</a>
                        as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature
                        is on the order of billionths of a kelvin for black holes of stellar mass, making it essentially impossible to observe.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by John Michell
                        and Pierre-Simon Laplace. The first modern solution of general relativity that would characterize a black hole was found by Karl Schwarzschild in
                        1916, although its interpretation as a region of space from which nothing can escape was first published by David Finkelstein in 1958. Black holes were
                        long considered a mathematical curiosity; it was during the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general relativity.
                        The discovery of neutron stars by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967 sparked interest in gravitationally collapsed compact objects as a possible astrophysical
                        reality.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black holes of stellar mass are expected to form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed, it can
                        continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. By absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes, supermassive black holes of millions
                        of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_mass" target="_blank">solar masses</a> (M<sub>☉</sub>) may form. There is consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centers of most galaxies.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other matter and with electromagnetic radiation such as visible light.
                        Matter that falls onto a black hole can form an external accretion disk heated by friction, forming some of the brightest objects in the universe. If there
                        are other stars orbiting a black hole, their orbits can be used to determine the black hole's mass and location. Such observations can be used to exclude
                        possible alternatives such as neutron stars. In this way, astronomers have identified numerous stellar black hole candidates in binary systems, and
                        established that the radio source known as Sagittarius A*, at the core of the Milky Way galaxy, contains a supermassive black hole of about 4.3 million solar

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A neutron star is the collapsed core of a giant star which before collapse had a total mass of between 10 and 29
                        solar masses. Neutron stars are the smallest and densest stars, excluding black holes, hypothetical white holes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark_star" target="_blank">

                        Neutron stars have a radius on the order of 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) and a mass of about 1.4 solar masses. They result from the supernova explosion of a

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once formed, they no longer actively generate heat, and cool over time; however, they may still evolve further through collision or accretion. Most of
                        the basic models for these objects imply that neutron stars are composed almost entirely of neutrons (subatomic particles with no net electrical charge
                        and with slightly larger mass than protons); the electrons and protons present in normal matter combine to produce neutrons at the conditions in a

                        by itself sufficient to hold up an object beyond 0.7M<sub>☉</sub> and repulsive nuclear forces play a larger role in supporting more massive neutron s

                        pressure and nuclear forces is insufficient to support the neutron star and it continues collapsing to form a black hole.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The origins of the earliest constellations likely go back to prehistory. People used them to relate stories of their beliefs, experiences, creation, or mythology. Different cultures and countries adopted their own constellations, some of which lasted into the early 20th century before today's constellations were internationally recognized. The recognition of constellations has changed significantly over time. Many have changed in size or shape. Some became popular, only to drop into obscurity. Others were limited to a single culture or nation.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 48 traditional Western constellations are Greek. They are given in Aratus' work Phenomena and Ptolemy's Almagest, though their origin probably predates these works by several centuries. Constellations in the far southern sky were added from the 15th century until the mid-18th century when European explorers began traveling to the Southern Hemisphere. Twelve ancient constellations belong to the zodiac (straddling the ecliptic, which the Sun, Moon, and planets all traverse). The origins of the zodiac remain historically uncertain; its astrological divisions became prominent c. 400 BC in Babylonian or Chaldean astronomy.

Any given point in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_coordinate_system" target="_blank">celestial coordinate system</a> lies in one of the modern constellations. Some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_designations_and_names" target="_blank">astronomical naming systems</a> include the constellation where a given celestial object is found to convey its approximate location in the sky. The Flamsteed designation of a star, for example, consists of a number and the genitive form of the constellation name.

The word galaxy is derived from the Greek galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally "milky", a reference to the Milky Way. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few hundred million (10<sup>8</sup>) stars to giants with one hundred trillion (10<sup>14</sup>) stars, each orbiting its galaxy's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass" target="_blank">center of mass</a>.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral, or irregular. Many galaxies are thought to have supermassive black holes at their centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*" target="_blank">Sagittarius A*</a>, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun. As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant observed galaxy with a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from Earth, and observed as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang.

Most of the galaxies are 1,000 to 100,000 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec" target="_blank">parsecs</a> in diameter (approximately 3000 to 300,000 light years) and separated by distances on the order of millions of parsecs (or megaparsecs). For comparison, the Milky Way has a diameter of at least 30,000 parsecs (100,000 ly) and is separated from the Andromeda Galaxy, its nearest large neighbor, by 780,000 parsecs (2.5 million ly.)

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our Solar System, with the name describing the galaxy's appearance from Earth: a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. The term Milky Way is a translation of the Latin via lactea, from the Greek γαλαξίας κύκλος (galaxías kýklos, "milky circle"). From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe. Following the 1920 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Debate_(astronomy)" target="_blank">Great Debate</a> between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.

It is estimated to contain 100–400 billion stars and more than 100 billion planets. The Solar System is located at a radius of about 27,000 light-years from the Galactic Center, on the inner edge of the Orion Arm, one of the spiral-shaped concentrations of gas and dust. The stars in the innermost 10,000 light-years form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulge_(astronomy)" target="_blank">bulge</a> and one or more bars that radiate from the bulge.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stars and gases at a wide range of distances from the Galactic Center orbit at approximately 220 kilometers per second. The constant rotation speed contradicts the laws of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion" target="_blank">Keplerian dynamics</a> and suggests that much (about 90%) of the mass of the Milky Way is invisible to telescopes, neither emitting nor absorbing electromagnetic radiation. This conjectural mass has been termed "dark matter". The rotational period is about 240 million years at the radius of the Sun. The Milky Way as a whole is moving at a velocity of approximately 600 km per second with respect to extragalactic frames of reference. The oldest stars in the Milky Way are nearly as old as the Universe itself and thus probably formed shortly after the Dark Ages of the Big Bang.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nebula (Latin for 'cloud' or 'fog'; pl. nebulae, nebulæ or nebulas) is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_cloud" target="_blank">interstellar cloud</a> of dust, hydrogen, helium and other ionized gases. Originally, the term was used to describe any diffuse astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, was once referred to as the Andromeda Nebula (and spiral galaxies in general as "spiral nebulae") before the true nature of galaxies was confirmed in the early 20th century by Vesto Slipher, Edwin Hubble and others.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most nebulae are of vast size; some are hundreds of light-years in diameter. A nebula that is visible to the human eye from Earth would appear larger, but no brighter, from close by. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Nebula" target="_blank">Orion Nebula</a>, the brightest nebula in the sky and occupying an area twice the diameter of the full Moon, can be viewed with the naked eye but was missed by early astronomers. Although denser than the space surrounding them, most nebulae are far less dense than any vacuum created on Earth – a nebular cloud the size of the Earth would have a total mass of only a few kilograms. Many nebulae are visible due to fluorescence caused by embedded hot stars, while others are so diffuse they can only be detected with long exposures and special filters. Some nebulae are variably illuminated by T Tauri variable stars. Nebulae are often star-forming regions, such as in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillars_of_Creation" target="_blank">"Pillars of Creation"</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Nebula" target="_blank">Eagle Nebula</a>. In these regions, the formations of gas, dust, and other materials "clump" together to form denser regions, which attract further matter, and eventually will become dense enough to form stars. The remaining material is then believed to form planets and other planetary system objects.
